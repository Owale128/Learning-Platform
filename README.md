# LearningPlatform - Exam project

This is a quiz game designed for 3-year-old children (toddlers), where users can choose different categories and test their knowledge in a playful way. Users begin by entering their name (with the help of a parent), and then they can select a category to start the quiz. The gaming experience is interactive and tailored for young children, with sounds and animations that make it more fun and engaging. The results of the quiz are displayed after completion, and users can choose to restart or switch categories. There is also a results list that compiles the scores of all users.

PS: Feel free to ask if you'd like to view the code, and I'll gladly invite you.
